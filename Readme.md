# WinForms Scheduler - Fetch appointments when binding to custom objects

This example demonstrates how to handle the [FetchAppointments](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraScheduler.SchedulerStorageBase.FetchAppointments) event to limit the number of appointments fetched from the data source. The Scheduler Control is bound to a collection of custom objects. 

Do not set the `SchedulerStorage.Appointments` or `SchedulerStorage.Appointments.DataSource` property in the `FetchAppointments` event handler. Update the collection (add/remove items) that is assigned to the `SchedulerStorage.Appointments.DataSource` property.

Read the following help topic for additional information: [FetchAppointments Event - Handling Large Datasets](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/8385/controls-and-libraries/scheduler/data-binding/fetchappointments-event-handling-large-datasets).
